7. Learning Journey:

Networking
  - Reflection: During the Cybersecurity course at Universiti Malaya, I gained hands-on experience with fundamental network configuration skills. This included virtual simulations using GNS3 and practical exercises with routers and switches in the computer lab. I learned to configure networks with concepts such as DHCP, ACL, GRE, subnetting, and IPsec.
  - Challenges: Understanding the difference between standard and extended ACLs, as well as their correct placement on interfaces, was quite challenging. It required several rounds of trial and error to successfully complete my assignments. I aim to solidify my understanding of ACL concepts for future projects.
  - Goal: To excel in networking and achieve CCNA certification by 2025.

Security Analysis
  - Reflection: While studying the HTB Academy course, I developed skills in log analysis using SIEM operations tools like ELK and Splunk. These tools enhanced my ability to monitor, identify, and respond to potential security incidents effectively.
  - Challenges: Analyzing logs proved to be a daunting task due to the overwhelming variety, including Active Directory logs, network traffic logs, and Sysmon logs. It took considerable effort, trial, and error to interpret them correctly, but persistence paid off, helping me pass the HTB CDSA exam.
  - Goal: Deepen my understanding of Red Team concepts, such as Active Directory attacks and network attacks, to enhance my log analysis skills and become more adept at detecting and mitigating security threats.
